# Weather Prediction

## Project Description
Developed a weather prediction model using historical weather data and linear regression. The model utilizes meteorological data such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure to predict future weather conditions. Two versions of the model were implemented: one for historical data analysis and another for live weather prediction based on user-provided location coordinates.

## Skills Developed
- Data fetching and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning model development
- Linear regression
- Live data prediction
- Geocoding (for live prediction)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- datetime module
- Meteostat API
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (LinearRegression)
- Geopy (Nominatim)
